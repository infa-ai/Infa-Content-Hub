Understanding Boards in the Infa Chrome Extension
=================================================

Introduction
------------

Boards within the Infa play a crucial role in organizing and managing Main Components. They not only serve as a central hub for component documentation but also offer flexibility in terms of access and sharing. Let's delve into the three types of boards available in Infa: Local, Community, and Private Boards.

Types of Boards
---------------

### Local Boards

Local boards are designed for individual use and experimentation. They allow users to:

-   Organize Main Components locally on their device.
-   Experiment with the Chrome Extension's functionality without affecting shared content.
-   Privacy: Ensures that your work remains private to your local instance of the Chrome Extension.

Local boards are ideal for users who prefer to work independently or are in the initial stages of exploring the Infa Chrome Extension's capabilities.

### Community Boards

Community boards are public and accessible to all users of the Infa Chrome Extension. These boards:

-   Showcase the Power of the Chrome Extension: Ideal for demos and educational purposes.
-   Encourage Sharing and Collaboration: Users can copy and share links to specific components within the community board.
-   Exportable to JSON: Allows users to download and explore the board's setup locally.

Community boards serve as a valuable resource for learning from and contributing to the collective knowledge of the Infa community.

### Private Boards

Private boards offer a balance between collaboration and control. In the free version of the Infa Chrome Extension, private boards allow users to:

-   Edit Component Details in a centralized location.
-   Manage Permissions and Access: Control who can view or edit the board and its components.
-   Collaborate Efficiently: Share component documentation and details within your team or organization securely.

Private boards are suitable for teams and organizations looking to use the Infa Chrome Extension for their projects while maintaining control over access and permissions.
