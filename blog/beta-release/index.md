### Infa Beta Release: Cloud Enablement

The beta release of Infa introduces cloud enablement, expanding on the functionality introduced in the [alpha release](https://infa.ai/blog/alpha-release). This update focuses on improving the efficiency and quality of your design system inventory process. By automating the capture of screenshots and code snippets, and enabling easy sharing of component links, Infa saves you time and ensures precision during the design system inventory process.

### Key Features and Benefits:

1\. Account Creation and Upgrades:

Synchronize your data across multiple devices. Free users can still use the Chrome extension and export/import JSON files, but Pro users can enjoy seamless data synchronization.

2\. Sync Boards and Components:

Keep your design system data consistent and up-to-date across all devices. This feature is available only for Pro accounts.

3\. Share Component Links:

Improve communication by sharing precise component locations with team members. Instead of manually annotating screenshots and URLs, simply share a link that highlights the exact component within the product. This method is faster and reduces misunderstandings, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

4\. Generate Screenshots of Components:

Save time and ensure accuracy with automated screenshots. Manually taking screenshots can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when determining component dimensions within the browser. Infa generates screenshots based on the DOM structure, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy and saving you significant effort.

5\. Capture Component Code:

Engineers can quickly verify if components use the correct design system elements. By examining class names and parameters, it's easy to determine if a component adheres to the design system standards or is a replicated variant. This saves time and ensures design consistency.

Additional Information:

Future Integrations:

-   Upcoming Features: We are working on integrations with Figma and other tools. Your feedback on the beta version will help shape these integrations.
