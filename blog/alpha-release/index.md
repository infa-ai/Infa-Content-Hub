# Elevate Your Design System Inventory and Visualize Design System Implementation with Infaâ€™s latest Chrome Extension

Exciting news for design system enthusiasts! The Infa Chrome Extension is set to transform your experience with design systems by visually revealing Design System usage directly within your product pages. This new tool allows teams to instantly identify and understand the utilization of design system components in real-time. By seamlessly integrating with your existing Infa architecture, the extension fetches and displays related Figma or Storybook links, bridging the gap between design documentation and its practical application. With this update, not only does it enhance the adoption and understanding of your design system across teams, but it also provides a powerful inventory capability to manage and interconnect your website's components more effectively. Prepare to elevate your product development with an immersive, contextual understanding of how your design system comes to life in actual product scenarios.
