This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Infa Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please read the [Code of Conduct In Progress](LINK_TO_CODE_OF_CONDUCT) before contributing.

## What We Are Looking For

We are looking for contributions that improve or enhance the content, including:

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
1. Ensure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
2. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Set up your local environment (if necessary).

For detailed setup instructions, see the README.md file.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update your fork to the latest upstream version.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes in your branch.
4. If applicable, add or update tests.
5. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style of the project to best match the overall code structure.
6. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found in the GitHub Guide: [Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Style Guide / Coding Conventions

(If applicable) Our style guidelines are documented [here In Progress](LINK_TO_STYLE_GUIDE).

## Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are hugely important! Before submitting a bug report, please review this checklist:
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/infa-ai/Infa-content-hub/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/infa-ai/Infa-content-hub/issues). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Proposing Content

Content proposals are welcome. But before creating [a new suggestion](LINK_TO_ISSUE_TEMPLATE), please check if it's already suggested or implemented. If it's something new, provide a clear and detailed explanation of the potential benefits and possible use cases.

## Community and Behavioral Expectations

- Respect all contributors and their contributions.
- Follow the guidelines outlined in our Code of Conduct.
- Be open to constructive criticism and embrace diversity.

We hope you enjoy contributing to Infa Content Hub. Thank you for your contributions!
